# What is Pawdy?

Pawdy is a 2022 Capstone project that is a website providing free pet sitting service exchange website for UW students. We hope to help student pet owners find pet sitting services they need, which can also help students build community as pet owners. For more information regarding Pawdy, check our landing page [here](). Currently, Pawdy is only focused on the University of Washington campus, but can be easily transitioned to other Universities.

2. Build new features to enhance user experience. We have designed a few features listed below that can be integrated into our product that we hope you can help build. 
- Feature 1: A rating & review feature - Users can rate and review other users based on their experience interacting with each other
- Feature 2: Pawdy Points - Users receive Pawdy Points from the pet owner when the user sits their pet. Pawdy points ensure fair sitting experience and incentivize users to pet sit.
- Feature 3: Find a sitter - Students without pets should be able to sign up for Pawdy to voluntarily sit pets in need. Pet owners should be able to filter & select different student sitters available with the best match. 
3. Extend the website to your University of choice(Optional) - You can transition the website to another university by changing the email requirement to the according university email.
